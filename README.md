What is Tetris?

It's the addictive puzzle game that started it all!

By embracing our universal desire to create order out of chaos, the Tetris game provides intellectual sport that combines continuous fun with mental stimulation.

As one of the most recognizable and influential video game brands in the world, itâ€™s no wonder why there are hundreds of millions of Tetris products being played, worn, and enjoyed by fans in their everyday lives. For over thirty-five years, the game and brand have truly transcended the barriers of culture and language, resulting in a fun and exciting playing experience for everyone, everywhere!


How do you play?

The Tetris game requires players to strategically rotate, move, and drop a procession of Tetriminos that fall into the rectangular Matrix at increasing speeds. Players attempt to clear as many lines as possible by completing horizontal rows of blocks without empty space, but if the Tetriminos surpass the Skyline the game is over! It might sound simple, but strategy and speed can go a long way! Are YOU up for the challenge?
